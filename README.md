# Batch Geocoding with Python and Google Geocoding API

This repository contains a python script to geocode multiple addresses using the Google Geocoding API.

Addresses can be geocoded for free at a rate of 2500 addresses per day, limited by Google. With a Google Developer API key, any number of addresses can be geocoded.

Data input and output is processed from CSV files.
